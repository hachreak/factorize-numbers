Implementation of three different algorithms to factorize prime numbers:
 - first algorithm
 - Pollard-Rho algorithm
 - Brent algorithm (Pollard-Rho optimization)
The web interface is used to contact the .cgi and ask to factorize number.
Enjoy it... ;)

Note: First algorithm is quick if the number of digits is not high.<br>
Otherwise, the other two algorithms should be faster, because are based on Floyd's 
cycle-finding algorithm and on the observation that (as in the birthday problem) 
two numbers x and y are congruent modulo p with probability 0.5 after 
1.177(sqrt{p}) numbers have been randomly chosen.
